This is a helper app for the logic problem puzzle books you can get. A specific
example is the ones by PuzzlerMedia (http://www.puzzlermedia.com)

It's all Javascript/jQuery code, primarily developed in Chrome. Looks a bit
weird in Firefox, and haven't tried it at all in IE.

* Loading/saving
* Web backend, maybe
